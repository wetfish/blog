            <h1>What is wetfish?</h1>

            <p>
                Wetfish is a creative community founded on the ideals of transparency and participation.
                We're an eclectic mix of developers, artists, and students&mdash;working together to preserve the magic of the 'net.
            <p>

            <p>
                Despite being scattered across the globe, technology unites us. And through the years we've learned to call this place our home.
            </p>

            <h2>Participation?</h2>

            <p>
                Everybody in Wetfish contributes in some way.
                From the big things like writing software or creating beautiful artwork,
                to the little things like offering advice or sharing something to laugh at.
            </p>

            <p>
                We facilitate participation by offering real-time communication platforms for both text and voice.
                Want to get involved? All of our projects are tracked on <a href='https://wetfish.net/trello'>Trello</a>, a kanban style platform for project management.
                And of course all the code behind Wetfish is available on <a href='https://github.com/wetfish'>GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Whether you're a mathematician or an engineer, an artist or musician, or even if you just work in retail, Wetfish would love to meet you!
            </p>

            <h2>Transparency?</h2>

            <p>
                We believe transparency is important across all scales.
                From the design of an operating system to the ingredients in the food you eat, information is a vital component of our lives.
                Restricting access to that information only hampers an individual's ability to make decisions and explore new uses for it.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Wetfish, transparency means we're open about what's happening in the community and where we want to take it.
                We're staunch supporters of the open-source movement and believe that systems should always be available for inspection by those who use it.
